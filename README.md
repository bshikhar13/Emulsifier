# Emulsifier

##Intro ::
A Facebook app which accesses your profile and likes data and gives a detailed 
overview about your personality.
Emulsifier will extract data from a person’s facebook profile using different 
facebook Graph APIs and will process it against the pre-stored data using many 
AI algorithms (text-processing and classifications) in order to get a complete 
general overview of user’s thoughts and characteristics.
In the world today, it is very difficult to find the real qualities, thoughts and 
flaws of a person. People tend to cover themselves in a fake gown of 
gentleness. A look into someone’s life is desired by many areas like the 
companies searching for suitable candidates, people searching for their desired 
marriage partners on matrimonial websites etc. The goal of Emulsifier is to 
provide us with a succinct character overview of a person.

##Abstract ::
People have an inherent need to express themselves to other people in the community by sharing
their experiences, ideas, activities, and memories. As a means, they mostly prefer to use social 
media such as Twitter, Facebook, personal blogs, and wikis. Many people consistently contribute to 
such social media platforms by writing their own experiences, sharing photos, status and liking. The 
majority of shared content is personal information. There are studies in the literature which make 
use of shared social media content to predict users’ Big 5 Personality Traits such as agreeableness, 
conscientiousness, extraversion, neuroticism and openness. These studies usually utilize linguistic 
features, social network information, and the frequency of their interaction with the platform such 
as number of posted status updates, photos, videos and likes. The aim of this project is to identify 
users’ Big 5 Personality Traits and develop a model based on page likes for personality prediction.
